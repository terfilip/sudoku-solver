# sudoku-solver
My Java implementation of Peter Norvigâ€™s [Sudoku solver](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html), that I wrote last May.
Included some test of Sudokus from the article, and grids for benchmarking from https://github.com/attractivechaos/plb/blob/master/sudoku/sudoku.txt

To run base test
```
rake test
```
To run benchmark
```
rake benchmark
```
